    "text": "Are we done with vibe coding yet?\n\nToo many software developers are obsessed with the surface layer when it comes to using AI. \n\nThe fun stuff is just a layer below.\n\nOver the last 12 months I've been using AI in production apps which has not only been fun, but has also significantly increased interest in my profile 😉.\n\nI won't call these tips or tricks. There aren't many standards when it comes to using these tools so I'll just share how I'm working with them:\n\n1. 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: LLMs can return the kind of structured data we expect in software development if you provide a schema. OpenAI supports this OOTB with Zod.\n2.  𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗜 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝘀: A small tweak to a prompt can break things fast. Using an LLM-as-a-judge in a unit test for a function that relies on an AI response has alerted me to breaking changes. I run these tests daily or before deploying since they are not free.\n3.  𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴: OpenAI caches prompts when the prefixes are the same. Keeping dynamic content at the end of a prompt saves time and a little bit of money.\n4. 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆: I'm done writing complicated parsing logic. I throw all the HTML from a scraping job to an LLM and it gives me a structured response.\n\nThere's so much more I'm exploring and experimenting with at work and at home including RAG, fine-tuning and agents. \n\nIt's a fun time to be a software developer.\n\n\nI'll be going deeper into all these methods with examples in Typescript this weekend: https://lnkd.in/g_DTazAE",

LinkedIn is social media. Like it or not. One student barely posted anything technical and made a connection with a hiring manager based on his posts. Remember, people are on social media to be entertained and connect with other humans, not read Chat-GPT generated slop about your CRUD app.\n3. 𝗕𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴. Let's be honest: coding bootcamps set a pretty low-bar for coding standards. Most have no curriculum on table stakes like unit-testing, back-end development or technical communication. I hate to be that guy - but after doing a ton of interviews during the pandemic hiring spree, I was shocked at the lack of fundamentals from many candidates.\n\n𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿: you can be really good, have thousands of followers and still not land a job in the timeline you expect.\n\nThere are simply too many factors to account for.\n\nBUT - if you do have a strong technical foundation and show up consistently by doing what we refer to as \"market development\" - then you're taking control of your future.\n\nYour timeline is your timeline.",

Even at an AI startup, principles mean something.\n• 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 > 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲\n  If a feature didn’t move a metric, he questioned it. He made sure we weren’t just shipping for the sake of it.

Perhaps leverage RAG. \n• Try and get a user or 3. \n• Buy a domain. \n• Set up analytics to track who’s on there and for how long.\n\nYou will walk away with a small business or a cool story that’s light years beyond a glorified TODO app.\n\n\n**\n\nAt Parsity, I'm consistently amazed at the projects our mentees cook up.

Now the real work begins:\n\n- Exploring a new codebase\n- Finding areas to make impact\n- Learning the engineering culture and the boatload of jargon (CI/CD, TDD, SDLC, story points, sprints) \n- Figuring out JIRA and the team's flavor of agile\n- Using git… but like, for real this time\n- Doing on-call 👹\n\nI’m beginning to think this is the area where developers need the most support. \n\nThe job search is stressful for sure but it makes up such a small portion of the developer life-cycle. You won’t be spending your days optimizing algorithms or manipulating palindromes.\n\nThe part after the interview is when the real work begins.\n\nIf you’re a recently hired developer, what are some areas where you wish you had more knowledge?",

If only it were that simple. \n\nI've done quite a lot of contract work over the years without ever using UpWork, Fiverr or any freelance site.\n\nA few students at Parsity have supplemented their own experience with freelance jobs. When I ask them about their approach, I see a lot similarities with what has worked for me:\n\n1. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹. Find a friend, business or organization that needs a site. If you can't think of one, 𝗱𝗼 𝗮 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 like child care centers, dentists or podiatrists and check out their sites.

Can you add functionality like appointment booking or payment processing?\n   \n3. 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗹𝘀. When you're starting off, it might be hard to gain trust or have the confidence to charge 1k for a 3 -5 page site. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Then never work for free again.\n   \nOne summer, as a 37 year old senior software engineer, I did 100 cold calls for my buddy's business so I could learn sales.\n\nIt was draining, uncomfortable and I dreaded it. \n\nI learned a ton.\n\nIf you don't have experience, you got to get it somehow.",

I volunteered to handle a code release, just like I've recommended in previous posts. \n\nThe lead developer was off that night and told me his process to merge a small change from one branch to production.\n\nSimple, I thought.\n\nHe scribbled his Git work flow on a whiteboard in a small office while I tried to hide my anxiety.

I also knew it was time for me to actually understand how to use Git.\n\nHere are a few things which helped me get Git before I got got... 🧐\n\n- use 𝚘𝚑𝚖𝚢𝚣𝚜𝚑 to 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗚𝗶𝘁-𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝘆\n- 𝗮𝗱𝗱 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀 so I could type things like 𝚐𝚌𝚘 instead of 𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚌𝚑𝚎𝚌𝚔𝚘𝚞𝚝\n- learn how to 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 within a branch with 𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚕𝚘𝚐\n- 𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘀 to see where I introduced a bug using 𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚋𝚒𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚝\n- 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 on a different branch 𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚌𝚑𝚎𝚌𝚔𝚘𝚞𝚝 <𝚋𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚑> -- 𝚙𝚊𝚝𝚑/𝚝𝚘/𝚏𝚒𝚕𝚎\n- understand how to 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚛𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚝 <𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚒𝚝-𝚑𝚊𝚜𝚑-𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖-𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚒𝚗𝚊𝚕-𝚛𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚝>\n- 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘀 into a branch with 𝚌𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚛𝚢-𝚙𝚒𝚌𝚔\n\nMy major flaw is that I was too concerned with memorizing a particular set of commands to achieve something.

𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝘀. Remove any mention of junior or aspiring and use this framework: did [x] using [y] which led to [z].

Want to understand how to implement role-based authentication or get your hands dirty with Serverless? Build it out. Also follow John Crickett , he has a ton of cool projects to make.\n   \n3.

It can be a fickle beast. Sometimes I’m pretty damn good at slinging code. Sometimes I suck. \n\nSo I hit the gym. Run around a lake. Read stuff.

I was confronted with my technical limitations and the realization that this wasn’t just all in my head. Everyone was better than me at writing code. \n \nI could barely keep up with the tasks I was assigned and relied on lots of pairing sessions to get my work done. \n \nThe company was small - only 3 engineers. They were the kind of developers who gave speeches at conferences and wrote the libraries that other devs use in their daily work. \n \nI could either quit or at least attempt to keep up with the other devs and contribute to the best of my ability. \n \nI resolved to suck a little less each day. \n \nI asked the smarty-pants devs what books they suggested I read \n \nI audited my Javascript knowledge and wrote out what I knew I had to learn to contribute to discussions \n \nI enrolled in a course to learn DSA and comp sci fundamentals \n \nSomeone made a joke about Djikstra once… who the hell is that?

What’s “complex”? I typically think of something you could potentially sell.  \n \nIf you’re unsure of where to start, look up APIs and build something around that API.

You want to create connections with software engineers and hiring managers so post the challenges you are facing, post some code for feedback and get into the weeds.  \n \nYou’re not posting for likes - you’re posting for the right kind of engagement from people in tech who can offer help, targeted advice or maybe a job. \n \n𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 - this works and I don’t care who says differently. Don’t JUST mass apply, however. Try a few resumes to see which one works. If you get no hits after 100 attempts, maybe hire a resume writer.  \n \nTry multiple platforms including LI and those other older sites like Craigslist (yeah, they have a section for software). \n \nThe only wrong path is the one you can’t commit to.

    "text": "Top 5 pieces of advice to save your resume for all your junior devs, including 1 I bet you never considered 👇 \n \n1. Stop calling yourself a junior or aspiring. You are a developer. \n \n2. Use strong language. “Led development on [x] feature which [improved some metric]” or “architected” sounds better than “worked with a team on [generic thing]” \n \n3. Lead with your relevant experience. It can be confusing to look at a resume for a dev role and see nothing coding related. Put your projects/volunteer work/side projects at the top. \n \n4. Don't get too cute with the format. Use a plain Word doc to be safe. \n \n5. Add a Loom video with a very brief intro or walkthrough of a project. Like 1 minute max. Now, track the views this video gets. No views? Maybe change your resume. Many views but no calls? Maybe remove the video 😅 \n \nWhat else would you suggest?",

I quit [a lot of stuff 😅] immediately with zero plan of how I was going to make it work or if I would succeed.\n\nI had lots of time to kill. I had no clue what normal people did for fun.\n\nI got introduced to HTML and CSS from a co-worker and my mind was blown. So this is how the internet works eh? How the hell did I not know this?\n\nCue my new addiction. I approached coding with the same unhealthy mindset as I did with, uhhh, previous things. It took over my life.\n\nIt worked well overall in that I made a transition that even my mother did not really believe was possible. \n\nBut I don’t suggest it.\n\nEat, sleep, code is a recipe for burnout, not success.\n\nOnce I incorporated exercise, reading and other hobbies into my life, I was happier, less anxiety-ridden and more confident.\n\nI still have a ways to go though, honestly. Even now, I tend to go overboard with any new interest, and while that sounds like a superpower it can also be at the expense of those around me and my own health.\n\nEvery once in a while, I share this embarrassing piece of my past in the hopes that a few readers will feel less alone who may be in a similar position. Just know that there are quite a few of us floating around out there and most just don’t post it online.",

I was forgettable.\n\nSo I forced myself to start contributing to discussions. \n\nI started by asking questions. 1 question per meeting.\n\nAs I grew in seniority, I realized there was a not-so-silent expectation that I would participate in and lead more discussions and proposals.\n\nI had to talk… a lot.\n\nHere are some communication hacks I’ve learned from studying others:\n\n- 𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬 𝘴𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 than you naturally do\n- your tone should 𝘨𝘰 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘩 𝘵𝘰 𝘭𝘰𝘸 in order to sound more confident (try it out)\n- 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 off a slide during a presentation\n- 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴 for emphasis and to keep people engaged during a presentation (point to stuff)\n- 𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘫𝘢𝘳𝘨𝘰𝘯 and aim for the simplest way to explain something (people will silently be thanking you and most are too embarrassed to admit they don’t understand something)\n\nLastly, the best hack I’ve discovered to help me with me communication is speaking into a camera using Loom. \n\nI challenge my mentees to do this as well. It’s a great habit you can apply immediately at work, especially on distributed, remote teams. Send a video explaining what you’ve done and why instead of 10 chats via slack or even worse, an email chain.\n\nAny communication/speaking tips I should add?",

I was pleasantly surprised when he pulled up his screen and showed me an offer letter! About as good a way to start my morning as I could imagine.\n\nI met Ramandeep Singh a few months ago. He had just graduated from a bootcamp and was looking for a role as a developer. We worked on all the technical aspects of preparing for interviews: Javascript features and concepts, algorithms and ReactJS. In retrospect, more than anything, I offered him support during a very demanding string of interviews, rejections and self-doubt.\n\nI am thoroughly impressed. It takes a lot of dedication to remain consistent when things just aren't going your way. This is exactly why most people fail. That little voice in the back of their head tells them every reason they won't or can't get hired. F*ck that voice.\n\nThis was a good reminder for me that technical skills are absolutely important to learn, but encouragement, empathy and support are equally needed. We're humans first.\n\nCongratulations Ramandeep Singh - incredibly well deserved!",

I suspect a lack of communication coupled with remote work has made us feel more isolated than ever. Funny thing is, the senior engineer at Amazon is feeling a lot of the same insecurities as the junior who just graduated.\n\nSo what do you do?\n\n- identify the gaps in your skill\n- resist the urge to procrastinate with endless tutorials\n- embrace the fact you can not learn everything and expose your ignorance\n- make a plan to earn your confidence by learning what intimidates you\n\n\n\n#licreatoraccelerator ",

No bootcamp, no CS degree and here he was getting interviews.\n\nSo while you’re adding a new shade of green to the banner on your resume or adding yet another language to your skillset, don’t forget to reach out to family, friends and acquaintances IRL.\n\n#licreatoraccelerator ",

There I was, confronted with my own limitations and the realization that this wasn’t just all in my head.\n\nI could barely keep up with the tasks I was assigned and relied on lots of pairing sessions to get my work done.\n\nThe company was small - only 3 engineers and they were the kind of developers who gave speeches at conferences and wrote the libraries that other devs use in their daily work.\n\nI could either quit or at least attempt to keep up with the other devs and contribute to the best of my ability.\n\nI made a resolution to suck less.\n\n- I asked the smarty-pants devs what books they suggested I read\n- I audited my Javascript knowledge and wrote out what I knew I had to learn to contribute to discussions\n- enrolled in a course to learn DSA and comp sci fundamentals\n- someone made a joke about Djikstra once… who the hell is that? I would find out\n\nI never became the 2nd worst developer at this company, but I grew my technical skills, confidence and threshold for failure.\n\nAs uncomfortable as it was, I know see just how pivotal this experience was.\n\nSo if you’re just starting out, or maybe on a new team and discovering just how little you know…good. Embrace the suck, expose your ignorance and be prepared to learn.",

If it is a junior or “entry-level” role I apply. There are two options that will occur once you apply, *that I know of* you either get to the next step or rejection. If I get the fun old rejection email, I just delete it and keep going. (I became desensitized to rejection emails because I am not the right flavor for every company, and I know that. I like Half Baked from Ben and Jerry’s doesn’t mean everyone will.)\n\nOh yeah, I also send emails or LinkedIn messages to the recruiters/hiring managers. Some people don’t like it and others have really liked it. (ex. I have met people who said don’t DM them and I have met great people who have helped my growth.)\n\nIf I’m not getting to the screening calls for at least 1/6 jobs I am applying for especially if I am meeting more than 75% of the JD. I would address my resume, the questions should be asked when looking at my resume such as:\n\nAm I portraying myself as a #developer/SWE?\nAm I discussing what I am capable of or what I can do?\nIs my resume grammatically correct?\nHow does the format of my resume look?\n\nIf I am getting to screening calls and not making the next round, then I would ask myself did I portray that I am capable of doing this job, and if am I asking the right questions. One of the many questions I have used as of late is, “From our call, my resume, and experience as a junior, would this team be accepting of a #juniorengineer?”\n\nIf I make it to the technical screen. This is where I am being tested to see if I am able to prove I can program for this company. I could confidently say this, the technical screens I have not passed I have had a 100% SUCCESS rate of NOT making it to the next round. 😂\n\nWhether ds&a, #javascript topics, trees, etc. It is tough to study for and know all these at least to me, at this point in my career, so I decided to spend more time working on javascript because understanding the basis is better than becoming great at ds&a when I did not know what closure, prototypical inheritance, promise, etc. My values are different on my journey than others so I can’t say what is important to each person. Thank you for this Brian.\n\nUpon getting passed these steps in the virtual on-site, which varies per company but ensuring that I am doing my best on the #technical round, and speaking to the product team, and hiring manager. If I don’t make it passed this area, I reach out and ask for feedback because I want to know where I came up short and how I can improve. \n\nIf I make it passed all these SUCCESSFULLY, I would hope to get an offer. \n\nAlways be your authentic self, it's tough to wear a mask all the time.\n\nAfter our call, I decided to post Louis!\n\nI also track my processes with https://lnkd.in/gAN6q2ui Thank you Teal for creating this great Software.",

For quite a while actually.\n\nSo what does that mean exactly?\n\nWell, for me that meant that I lacked a lot of the core fundamentals needed to understand Javascript. The framework, AngularJS at the time, was an abstraction I didn’t just leverage but depended on to be useful. \n\nI didn’t know JS so much as I knew AngularJS (RIP).\n\nWhat changed? Well, once I moved companies, frameworks and teams, I quickly realized how little I knew. I went back to the drawing board, enrolled in a bootcamp while being employed as a developer and read books that my co-workers recommended. I built stuff and broke stuff.\n\nNow, I mentor other JS developers and one of the first assignments we do is an exercise to create a form that submits some data to a placeholder API. No framework allowed!\n\nI sent this challenge out to around 400 people on Saturday.\nCheck it out here: https://lnkd.in/gsWfuTBx\n\nI can promise you will find this either:\n  a. incredibly simple\n  b. eye-openingly difficult to complete\n\nNo judgement or shame here. I’m curious, which camp do you fall under?\n\n#javascript #frontenddevelopment #juniordeveloper #vanillajs",

So we:\n\n- Set a testing threshold in our pipeline\n- Created videos and short tutorials on unit testing\n- Used code coverage tools to ensure we were testing what we thought\n\nIf you’re new to unit testing and want to learn I’m excited to share a course I’ve created which includes source code, videos, articles and most importantly challenges to teach you unit testing and testing ReactJS components.\n\nIt’s all the stuff I wish I had learned when I started and it will shorten your path to unit testing proficiency with real world applications.\n\nIt’s 19.99 right now and if you happen to be in a difficult financial situation or from a country where $20 might be a significant expense, please DM me for a very super secret special discount code 😉.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gWbv4peB\n\n#reactjs #javascript #unittesting #unittest #juniordeveloper",

Without a grasp of the fundamentals upon which it was built, you’re now tied to the abstraction.\n\nSo how do you go from framework dev to JS dev? \n\nDouble down on the fundamentals.\n\nAsync, closure, DOM, promises, prototypal inheritance, design patterns and of course 'this' 😉.\n\nI'm particularly fond of this site for learning design patterns in JS:",

They are highly competitive and usually mean a lowball offer.\n\n✅ Use other platforms besides LI. Craigslist, anyone? You'd be shocked how many businesses still post CL ads for developers 🤷🏽‍♂️. Also checkout angel.co, a job board for startups.\n\n✅ Get 500 connections on LI. It will make you more discoverable when recruiters search for developers using keywords like \"Javascript\".\n\n✅ Don't stop coding. Keep your Github profile up to date by doing small commits regularly. A lot of employers will look at your GH history and a sharp drop in commits after graduating a program can be a red flag to many people.\n\n✅ Remember luck plays a part in this. This is ultimately a numbers game. Don't stop playing the game until you've \"won\". The worst thing you can do is give up when things get tough.\n\n✅ Don't do the same damn thing if it's not working. No interviews? Tweak your resume or LI profile. Remove the open to work badge maybe. Failing every interview? Invest in LC premium or AlgoExpert or a mentor to target your weak areas.\n\nWhew... now tell me, what did I miss here? Especially if you're a recent grad that landed a role as a developer, I'm curious to hear what worked for you?",

Would they rescind the offer if I asked for more? Laugh me off the phone call? Would my expectations change with more money?\n\nIt took me about 4 years until I figured out the power of salary negotiations by taking the advice from a recruiter I was working with. It was uncomfortable and nerve-wracking.

The first offer you receive is almost always lower than what is available. This is because, the company EXPECTS that you will negotiate. When you don't, you've made their job much easier and in return you've left money on the table.\n\nNegotiating isn't always about salary either. Maybe you need an additional day to work from home. Shorter hours on a certain day of the week or a sign on bonus.\n\nI don't care if it's your first role. Negotiate. More money than you expected? Negotiate. Don't want to negotiate?

That phrase pretty accurately describes how I felt too, sometimes how I feel now (shh, don't tell anybody). I vividly remember the first couple years of getting paid to write code, wondering when/if I would be fired. \n\nTo my surprise, almost 6 years later, I'm still here and feeling a little less fake each year. \n\nCheers to all you fake #software devs out there, you're not alone and hopefully that big voice of doubt in your head will get a little smaller with each bug you squash, problem you solve and on-call rotation you survive.",

I wanted to learn React, NodeJS and MongoDB so I used them in a side-project/start-up project with the intention of taking these new skills to my next role. Before this I was using #angularjs (don't hate) Ember, Rails, SQL and C#. I use exactly 0% of these skills in my new job but 102% of the technologies I used in my side project project are in my daily stack at work (I' m no mathematician, so these figures may not be accurate). \n\nWhile the #30daychallenge for coding is a great idea, I think there's a lot to be said for taking on a larger project to really internalize some of the concepts and frameworks which take longer than a day. \n\n ",

Within 4 days, each team had successfully created a project (not writing tests for the win!) and we got to show off our creations. The real benefit of weeks like this is that these projects often end up being incorporated in our actual applications, driving innovation and also creating opportunities to work across teams. Makes me wonder why more companies don't do this. #zignallabs #hacktoberfest ",

I got into coding late in life but if we want more women and POC sitting next to us with their earphones on drinking lacroix while looking up the latest JS framework, we need to reach kids like this earlier and introduce to them to what coding is. Almost none of these students who live in SF had any clue about coding or exactly what it entailed which is kinda shocking considering they live in the epicenter of tech.\n\nI hope they take what they’ve learned and can fill in some more of the gaps as they continue working on their personal sites.  #zignallabs",
