There are many definitions, many of which involve trying different experiences, searching for new solutions, exercising our brains, and meeting and talking with new people. To be creative we need to believe in our skills and step outside our comfort zones in the search for new challenges. This book is a discussion of creativity in four parts: creativity behaviour, creativity learning, creativity in science and arts, and creativity tendencies. Chapters address such topics as creativity in children, creativity in education, creativity at the emotional level, and more."

          "Find out about links between brain function and teaching creativity. Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) Dr. Paul Howard-Jones of Bristol University carried out an experiment investigating a strategy that is commonly used in the classroom to foster creativity. The strategy asks students to incorporate random stimuli into the work they are producing. The stimulus could be a piece of art, a poem or a play that is unrelated to the task in hand. The FMRI scans revealed a substantial increase in creative brain activity using this strategy. The results imply a need to allow sufficient time to develop a quality creative outcome."

          "How can you keep your class engaged and their learning on track? Nine teachers from schools across the UK talk about creativity, what is it and how they use it. Creativity isn't just art; these teachers talk about their responsibility to engage pupils in lessons, whether they are teaching times-tables or science. Being a creative teacher is demanding and a key skill is flexibility in planning, and in the approach to lessons. Whether it's speaking in an Australian accent, dressing up, using first hand experiences, or bringing in packed suitcases for a geography class, these teachers use interactive techniques to motivate and inspire creativity in their pupils. Sometimes this means the teacher modelling a creative response, which can be tough, risky and for some scary. And - what is it that kills creativity in the classroom?"
